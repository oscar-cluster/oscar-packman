packman-3.0.4:
* Fixes bug #460: PackMan from now monitors sub-command execution and detect
error messages (searching for messages starting by "ERROR").

packman-3.0.3:
* Add a status request: gives information about a given packman object.
* Do not include empty local repositories (they make repository management
more complex).

packman-3.0.2:
* Enhance the packman script: no irrelevant warnings when PackMan is directly
installed on the system (no OSCAR_HOME).

packman-3.0.1:
* Fix a bug with the packman script.

packman-3.0.0:
* Remove DepMan, which is deprecated.
* Match both the Debian and RPM package: a single packman package.

packman-2.9.2:
* Revisit the Makefile in order to be able to use it on both RPM and Debian
based systems (the best of the different scripts).
* Revisit the spec file in order to use the Makefile everytime it is possible
(easier to maintain the code).

packman-2.9.1:
* For Debian, switch back to apt-get instead of aptitude; problems with
untrusted packages.
* Add a simple packman script in order to allow one to use packman as a stand
alone tool.

packman-2.9.0:
* Fixed query_installed bugs
* Added whatprovides method to RPM module, this is missing in Debian
* Added check_installed method for checking if a list of packages is installed
* Added search_repo method for searching a repository for packages matching a 
pattern
* Added clean method implementation for apt caches
* Limited clean method scope to the configured repositories

packman-2.8.1:
* Add the option "--allow-unauthenticated" when using "apt-get install". This
is needed because of the switch to Etch.
* Update the package to make it more compliant with the Debian policy.
* Add debugging information.
* Change the order of preference for backends, it is now (DEB, RPM).
