packman-3.3.0:
- Adapt to new oscarsamples directory structure.
- Now has a clean image bootstrapping mechanism.

packman-3.2.3:
- Migrated to new OSCAR::Logger::oscar_log
- Added debug option
- Fixed debian packaging warnings.

packman-3.2.2:
- Moved modules to %{perl_vendorlib}
- Fixed so called ugly hack in PackMan.pm (now useless)
- enabled automatic dependancy generator in rpm.

packman-3.2.1:
- Added support for package meta names like perl(Pod::Man) or
glibc-devel(x86-32).
- Automatically detect the source directory on RPM based systems (patch from
- rpm: fixed the %file section to avoid including system directories and conflict
with the filesystem pachage.
- rpm: Added the dist tag in the release of the rpm.

packman-3.2.0:
* Reorganize slightly the code.
* The packman script tries to detect the local distribution if not distribution
is specified.
* Include the support of a list command which allows to get the list of all
installed packages.

packman-3.1.12:
* Improve PackMan output.
* Avoid useless warning messages when printing packman output.

packman-3.1.11:
* Make sure the repository array was a single repository per element.

packman-3.1.10:
* Before to include a repository, we check that the repository URL is valid
(if not the repository is not used). This avoids packman to crash when the
OSCAR or distro repository is not yet defined.
* Disable some debugging messages outside of the verbose mode.

packman-3.1.9:
* Call the correct function backend when removing packages.
* Fix a problem when using package to remove package: the command was not correctly built.

packman-3.1.8:
* Correctly bootstrap RPM based images.

packman-3.1.7:
* Deactivate try_ptty.
* Packages are not installed twice any more during the installation of a set
of packages.
* Fix different issues when installing packages in the smart mode.

packman-3.1.6:
* Fix a failure when trying the prepare an empty repository.
* Modify the Makefile so we can choose the directory to save sources when
creating RPMs.
* Modify the Makefile so we can choose the directory where the binary packages
are stored.
* Fix the smart_remove packman command.

packman-3.1.5:
* Fix the verbose option: now we really get all the output.
* Display less output when the verbose option is not used.
* Disable ptty_try when using RAPT in the backend.

packman-3.1.4:
* Fix a bug in the search capability on RPM based systems.
* Remove some debugging messages.

packman-3.1.3:
* Implement the image bootstrapping for RPM based systems.
* Better error handling.
* Include a "rpm" target to the Makefile; it is not possible to execute "make
rpm".
* Improve the spec file.

packman-3.1.2:
* Improve the packman script: make the script more stable, add the support of
the remove, search and show commands.
* Clean up the man page and the different Perl docs.
* Fix the "show" and "search" commands on RPM based systems.

packman-3.1.1:
* Fix a bug in the declaration and exportation of constants. Now we can use
them outside of PackMan without warnings or errors.

packman-3.1.0:
* Enable to specification of a distro ID (OS_Detect syntax) to a PackMan 
object.
* Finalize the support of "show" and "search" commands.
* Store the concrete module format used in the backend (DEB vs. RPM).
* Extend the packman script to support package installation.
* Disable the remove function which is deprecated.

packman-3.0.6:
* Fix a bug introduced in 3.0.5, the location for the installation of Perl
modules was automatic but we did not add OSCAR in the path, leading with
issues with the OSCAR core.
* Install Perl modules in "vendorlib"

packman-3.0.5:
* Fixes bug #474: We automatically detect where the Perl modules should be
installed.

packman-3.0.4:
* Fixes bug #460: PackMan from now monitors sub-command execution and detect
error messages (searching for messages starting by "ERROR").

packman-3.0.3:
* Add a status request: gives information about a given packman object.
* Do not include empty local repositories (they make repository management
more complex).

packman-3.0.2:
* Enhance the packman script: no irrelevant warnings when PackMan is directly
installed on the system (no OSCAR_HOME).

packman-3.0.1:
* Fix a bug with the packman script.

packman-3.0.0:
* Remove DepMan, which is deprecated.
* Match both the Debian and RPM package: a single packman package.

packman-2.9.2:
* Revisit the Makefile in order to be able to use it on both RPM and Debian
based systems (the best of the different scripts).
* Revisit the spec file in order to use the Makefile everytime it is possible
(easier to maintain the code).

packman-2.9.1:
* For Debian, switch back to apt-get instead of aptitude; problems with
untrusted packages.
* Add a simple packman script in order to allow one to use packman as a stand
alone tool.

packman-2.9.0:
* Fixed query_installed bugs
* Added whatprovides method to RPM module, this is missing in Debian
* Added check_installed method for checking if a list of packages is installed
* Added search_repo method for searching a repository for packages matching a 
pattern
* Added clean method implementation for apt caches
* Limited clean method scope to the configured repositories

packman-2.8.1:
* Add the option "--allow-unauthenticated" when using "apt-get install". This
is needed because of the switch to Etch.
* Update the package to make it more compliant with the Debian policy.
* Add debugging information.
* Change the order of preference for backends, it is now (DEB, RPM).
